Please review the following code:

```python
def calculate_sum(numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    return total
```

Provide feedback on:
1. Code quality
2. Performance
3. Best practices
4. Suggestions for improvement
","
Code Review:

1. Code Quality: The code is clear and readable.

2. Performance: Good for small lists. For very large lists, consider using sum().

3. Best practices:
   - Add docstring
   - Add type hints
   - Handle edge cases (empty list, non-numeric values)

4. Suggestions:
```python
def calculate_sum(numbers: list[float]) -> float:
    '''Calculate the sum of numbers in a list.'''
    if not numbers:
        return 0.0
    return sum(numbers)
```

Let's solve this step by step:

Question: If a train travels 120 miles in 2 hours, what is its average speed?

Think through this carefully.
","
Step 1: Identify the given information
- Distance: 120 miles
- Time: 2 hours

Step 2: Recall the speed formula
Speed = Distance / Time

Step 3: Calculate
Speed = 120 miles / 2 hours = 60 miles per hour

Answer: The train's average speed is 60 mph.
