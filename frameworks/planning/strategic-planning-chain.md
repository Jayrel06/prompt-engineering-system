# Strategic Planning Chain Framework

## Purpose
Multi-stage thinking process for comprehensive strategic planning. Works through landscape analysis to implementation planning.

## When to Use
- Quarterly/annual planning
- Major business decisions
- New market entry
- Product strategy

---

## Stage 1: Landscape Analysis

### External Environment
- Market trends
- Competitive dynamics
- Customer needs evolution
- Technology changes
- Regulatory environment

### Internal State
- Current capabilities
- Resource constraints
- Past performance
- Team strengths/weaknesses

### Key Questions
- What's changing in our environment?
- Where are we strong/weak?
- What opportunities exist?
- What threats are emerging?

---

## Stage 2: Option Generation

### Brainstorm Possibilities
Generate multiple strategic options without filtering.

**Categories:**
- Growth options (new markets, products, customers)
- Efficiency options (cost reduction, automation)
- Partnership options (acquisitions, alliances)
- Pivot options (different direction entirely)

### Quantity Over Quality
Aim for 10+ options before evaluating.

---

## Stage 3: Trade-off Evaluation

### For Each Option

| Option | Upside | Downside | Resources | Timeline | Fit |
|--------|--------|----------|-----------|----------|-----|
| | | | | | |

### Evaluation Criteria
- Strategic fit with vision
- Resource requirements
- Risk level
- Time to value
- Competitive response

### Narrow to Top 3
Select options with best overall profile.

---

## Stage 4: Implementation Planning

### For Selected Strategy

**90-Day Milestones**
- What must be true in 30 days?
- What must be true in 60 days?
- What must be true in 90 days?

**Key Initiatives**
- Initiative 1: [Description, owner, timeline]
- Initiative 2: [Description, owner, timeline]
- Initiative 3: [Description, owner, timeline]

**Resource Allocation**
- What gets more resources?
- What gets fewer resources?
- What gets stopped entirely?

---

## Stage 5: Risk Mitigation

### Risk Identification
For each major initiative:
- What could go wrong?
- What assumptions might be wrong?
- What external factors could change?

### Mitigation Strategies
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|------------|--------|------------|-------|
| | | | | |

### Monitoring Plan
- Leading indicators to watch
- Decision points / checkpoints
- Trigger for course correction
