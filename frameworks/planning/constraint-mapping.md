# Constraint Mapping Framework

## Purpose
Identify and categorize all constraints on a problem. Separate real constraints from assumed ones.

## When to Use
- Feeling stuck on a problem
- When solutions seem impossible
- Before accepting limitations
- When scope seems overwhelming

---

## The Process

### Stage 1: List All Constraints
Write down everything limiting your options.

**Categories:**
- **Hard constraints:** Truly immutable (laws of physics, regulations)
- **Firm constraints:** Very difficult to change (budget, deadlines)
- **Soft constraints:** Assumptions that feel like constraints
- **Self-imposed:** Rules you've created

### Stage 2: Categorize and Question

| Constraint | Category | Why It Exists | What Would Change It? |
|------------|----------|---------------|----------------------|
| | | | |

**For each constraint, ask:**
- Is this actually true?
- Who says so?
- What evidence supports this?
- Has anyone ever violated this constraint?
- What would happen if we ignored it?

### Stage 3: Identify Binding Constraints
Which constraints are actually limiting you right now?

**A binding constraint:**
- Directly prevents desired outcome
- Would immediately help if removed
- Is the actual bottleneck

**Non-binding constraints:**
- Exist but aren't currently limiting
- Would only matter if other constraints removed

### Stage 4: Work Within vs Remove

**For each binding constraint:**

| Constraint | Work Within | Work to Remove | Ignore |
|------------|-------------|----------------|--------|
| Strategy | | | |
| Effort Required | | | |
| Probability of Success | | | |

### Stage 5: Reframe the Problem
With constraints clarified, restate the problem:

"Given [hard constraints], how might we [objective] while [managing soft constraints]?"

## Output Format

1. **Constraint Inventory:** All constraints categorized
2. **Binding Constraints:** The actual bottlenecks
3. **Questionable Constraints:** Assumptions to challenge
4. **Reframed Problem:** New statement accounting for real constraints
5. **Path Forward:** Strategy for each binding constraint

## Constraint Categories

### Hard Constraints (Truly Fixed)
- Laws of physics
- Legal requirements
- Existing contracts
- Past decisions that can't be undone

### Firm Constraints (Difficult to Change)
- Budget (this cycle)
- Deadlines (externally imposed)
- Team skills (short-term)
- Existing technical architecture

### Soft Constraints (Changeable with Effort)
- "The way we've always done it"
- Assumed customer preferences
- Internal processes
- Tool choices

### Self-Imposed (Fully Within Control)
- Quality standards
- Scope definitions
- Timeline padding
- Risk tolerance
