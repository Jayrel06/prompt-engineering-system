# Quarterly Planning Framework

## Purpose
Set focused objectives and measurable key results for a 3-month period, balancing ambition with achievability.

## When to Use
- Every quarter (obviously)
- When transitioning between strategies
- After major milestones or pivots
- To align team on priorities

---

## The Process

### Stage 1: Review Previous Quarter
Learn before planning forward.

**What happened:**
- Objectives set vs achieved
- Key results: actual vs target
- Major accomplishments
- What consumed time unexpectedly

**Analysis:**
| Previous OKR | Target | Actual | % Achieved | Why Gap Exists |
|--------------|--------|--------|------------|----------------|
| | | | | |

**Key questions:**
- What worked well? (Do more of this)
- What didn't work? (Stop or change)
- What did we learn?
- What carried over? (Still important?)

**Honesty check:**
- Were we too ambitious? Too conservative?
- Did we focus on what mattered?
- Did external factors change priorities?
- Do our objectives still make sense?

### Stage 2: Assess Current State
Where are we right now?

**Business metrics:**
- Revenue/growth trajectory
- Customer metrics (acquisition, retention, satisfaction)
- Product metrics (usage, engagement)
- Team metrics (size, capacity, morale)

**Resource inventory:**
- Team capacity (accounting for PTO, existing commitments)
- Budget available
- Technical capabilities
- Time constraints (holidays, events, deadlines)

**External factors:**
- Market changes
- Competitive moves
- Industry trends
- Customer feedback themes

**Constraints:**
- What's locked in? (committed features, contracts, events)
- What's at risk? (retention issues, technical debt, people)
- What's limiting? (budget, skills, technology)

### Stage 3: Set Objectives
3-5 meaningful objectives for the quarter.

**Good objectives are:**
- **Qualitative:** What you want to achieve
- **Ambitious:** Stretch, but possible
- **Meaningful:** Actually matter to business/mission
- **Focused:** Can remember without looking
- **Inspirational:** Team wants to achieve them

**Objective categories:**
- **Growth:** Revenue, customers, market
- **Product:** Features, quality, technical
- **Team:** Hiring, culture, capability
- **Operations:** Efficiency, process, infrastructure

**Template:**
```
Objective: [Clear, inspirational goal]
Why it matters: [Connection to bigger picture]
Success looks like: [Qualitative vision]
```

**Example objectives:**
- "Establish product-market fit with enterprise customers"
- "Build foundation for scalable growth"
- "Create best-in-class onboarding experience"

**Not good objectives:**
- "Grow revenue" (no specificity)
- "Launch 47 features" (not meaningful)
- "Work hard" (not measurable)

### Stage 4: Define Key Results
2-5 measurable results per objective.

**Good key results are:**
- **Quantitative:** Specific numbers
- **Measurable:** Can definitively say achieved or not
- **Time-bound:** By end of quarter
- **Outcome-focused:** Results, not activities
- **Challenging:** 70% confidence of achievement

**Format:**
```
[Verb] [Metric] from [Current] to [Target] by [Date]
```

**Examples:**
- Increase trial-to-paid conversion from 8% to 15%
- Reduce average time-to-value from 14 days to 3 days
- Achieve NPS of 50+ with enterprise customers
- Grow MRR from $50k to $100k

**KR quality check:**
- [ ] Number is specific
- [ ] Can measure objectively
- [ ] Achievable but challenging
- [ ] Outcome, not output
- [ ] Directly ties to objective

### Stage 5: Resource Allocation
How will you actually achieve this?

**For each objective:**

**Required investments:**
| Resource Type | Allocation | Gaps |
|---------------|------------|------|
| People (hours/week) | | |
| Budget | | |
| Technology/tools | | |
| External help | | |

**Trade-offs accepted:**
- What are we NOT doing to focus on this?
- What maintenance/operations continue?
- What requests will we say no to?

**Dependencies:**
- What needs to happen first?
- Who do we need help from?
- What could block us?

**Timeline:**
```
Month 1: [Focus areas]
Month 2: [Focus areas]
Month 3: [Focus areas]
```

### Stage 6: Risk Assessment
What could prevent success?

**For each objective, identify:**

**Risks:**
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | |

**Common risk types:**
- **Execution:** Can we actually do this?
- **Dependencies:** What if X doesn't happen?
- **External:** Market changes, competitor moves
- **Resource:** What if we lose people/budget?
- **Technical:** Harder than expected?

**Backup plans:**
- If we're behind at month 1.5, what changes?
- What's the minimum viable success?
- What can we descope without killing the objective?

### Stage 7: Establish Cadence
How will you track progress?

**Check-in rhythm:**
- **Weekly:** Quick status check (15 min)
- **Monthly:** Detailed review, adjust if needed (1 hour)
- **End of quarter:** Full retrospective and next quarter planning

**Tracking method:**
- Dashboard with current metrics
- Status: On track / At risk / Off track
- Blockers and help needed
- Key decisions made

**Success criteria:**
- What does "achieved" look like for each KR?
- How do we measure (tools, process)?
- Who owns each metric?

## Output Format

Create a quarterly plan document:

1. **Quarter Overview**
   - Quarter and year
   - Theme or focus (one sentence)
   - Key context or changes from last quarter

2. **Previous Quarter Review**
   - Achievement summary
   - Key learnings
   - Carry-overs

3. **Objectives and Key Results**
   For each objective:
   - Objective statement
   - Why it matters
   - Key Results (with targets)
   - Owner
   - Resources allocated

4. **What We're NOT Doing**
   - Explicit trade-offs
   - Deferred priorities
   - Requests we'll decline

5. **Risks and Mitigations**
   - Top risks identified
   - Mitigation strategies

6. **Check-in Cadence**
   - Review schedule
   - Tracking method
   - Decision-making process

## OKR Best Practices

### Objectives
- Start with verb: "Build," "Achieve," "Establish," "Create"
- Should excite the team
- Usually 3-5 per quarter (individuals: 1-3)
- Should connect to company/team mission

### Key Results
- Start with metric verb: "Increase," "Reduce," "Achieve," "Grow"
- Include current and target state
- 70% confidence = right difficulty
- Don't confuse activities with results
  - Bad: "Launch new feature" (activity)
  - Good: "Increase activation rate to 40%" (result)

### Common Mistakes

**Too many OKRs:**
- Can't focus on everything
- Team gets scattered
- Nothing gets finished
- Recommendation: 3-5 objectives max

**Sandbagging:**
- Setting easy targets you'll definitely hit
- Defeats the purpose
- Should achieve 70-80% on average

**All output, no outcome:**
- "Ship 10 features" = output
- "Increase retention by 15%" = outcome
- Focus on outcomes

**No connection to daily work:**
- OKRs in document, work happens elsewhere
- Weekly work should tie to OKRs
- If it doesn't, either wrong OKRs or wrong work

### Scoring at Quarter End
- **1.0:** Achieved everything (may have sandbagged)
- **0.7-0.9:** Good, appropriately ambitious
- **0.4-0.6:** Stretched too far or execution issues
- **<0.4:** Serious problems or poor planning

## Adaptation for Different Contexts

### Early Stage Startup
- Shorter cycles (monthly OKRs)
- More flexible, adjust as you learn
- Focus on finding product-market fit
- Fewer objectives, deeper focus

### Growth Stage
- Balance growth and foundation
- More cross-functional alignment needed
- Resource allocation more complex
- Track leading indicators closely

### Solo/Small Teams
- 1-3 objectives maximum
- More conservative key results
- Account for all time (not just project work)
- Buffer for unexpected (25-30%)

### Department vs Company
- Department OKRs support company OKRs
- Clear line from individual → team → company
- Avoid conflicting incentives
- Coordinate dependencies
