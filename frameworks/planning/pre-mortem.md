# Pre-Mortem Analysis Framework

## Purpose
Imagine the project has failed and work backwards to identify what went wrong. Surfaces risks that optimism bias normally hides.

## When to Use
- Before starting significant projects
- When stakes are high
- When you feel overly confident
- Before major decisions or launches

## The Process

### Stage 1: Set the Scene
Imagine it's [timeframe] from now. The project has completely failed.

**Describe the failure:**
- What does failure look like specifically?
- Who is affected and how?
- What's the damage (reputation, money, time, relationships)?

### Stage 2: Brainstorm Causes
Generate as many failure causes as possible. Don't filter—quantity over quality.

**Categories to explore:**
- **Technical failures:** What broke?
- **People failures:** Who dropped the ball?
- **Process failures:** What wasn't followed?
- **External failures:** What changed unexpectedly?
- **Assumption failures:** What did we get wrong?
- **Communication failures:** What wasn't said?
- **Resource failures:** What ran out?

### Stage 3: Assess Likelihood and Impact

| Failure Mode | Likelihood (1-5) | Impact (1-5) | Risk Score |
|--------------|------------------|--------------|------------|
| | | | |

**Focus on high likelihood + high impact items.**

### Stage 4: Identify Warning Signs
For each major risk, what early signals would indicate we're heading toward failure?

| Risk | Early Warning Signs | How to Monitor |
|------|---------------------|----------------|
| | | |

### Stage 5: Mitigation Strategies
For top risks, develop specific mitigation plans.

**For each risk:**
1. **Prevention:** How to reduce likelihood
2. **Detection:** How to catch it early
3. **Response:** What to do if it happens
4. **Recovery:** How to minimize damage

### Stage 6: Action Items
Convert insights into concrete next steps.

| Action | Owner | Deadline | Prevents Which Risk |
|--------|-------|----------|---------------------|
| | | | |

## Output Format

1. **Failure Scenario** (vivid description)
2. **Top 5 Risks** (with likelihood, impact, and mitigation)
3. **Warning Signs to Watch** (specific, measurable)
4. **Preventive Actions** (immediate steps)
5. **Contingency Plans** (if X happens, we do Y)

## Questions to Ask

- What could go wrong that we're not talking about?
- What's the uncomfortable truth no one wants to acknowledge?
- What happened in similar projects that failed?
- What would our harshest critic say is going to fail?
- What are we hoping won't happen?
