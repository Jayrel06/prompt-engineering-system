# Opportunity Cost Framework

## Purpose
Evaluate what you're giving up by choosing one path. Prevents defaulting to first option without considering alternatives.

## When to Use
- Choosing between projects
- Allocating limited resources (time, money, attention)
- Evaluating whether to continue or pivot
- Any significant commitment decision

## The Process

### Stage 1: Define the Decision
What are you deciding between?

**State clearly:**
- The primary option you're considering
- The alternatives you're comparing against
- The resources being allocated (time, money, attention, opportunity)
- The time horizon for this decision

### Stage 2: List All Alternatives
Don't just compare A vs B. What else could you do with these resources?

**Alternative categories:**
- Do nothing (maintain status quo)
- Do the obvious alternative
- Do something completely different
- Wait and decide later
- Smaller version of the option
- Bigger version of the option

### Stage 3: Evaluate Each Option

| Option | Benefits | Costs | Probability of Success | Time to Value |
|--------|----------|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| | | | | |

### Stage 4: Calculate True Cost
For each option, what do you give up?

**True cost = Direct cost + Opportunity cost**

- **Direct cost:** Money, time, resources spent
- **Opportunity cost:** Value of best alternative foregone

### Stage 5: Consider Reversibility

| Option | Reversible? | Cost to Reverse | Time to Learn if Wrong |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| | | | |

**Two-way doors:** Low commitment, easy to reverse
**One-way doors:** High commitment, hard to reverse

### Stage 6: Make the Decision
Based on analysis, what's the right choice?

## Output Format

1. **Decision Statement:** What you're choosing between
2. **Options Evaluated:** With key trade-offs
3. **True Cost Analysis:** Including opportunity costs
4. **Recommendation:** With rationale
5. **Reversibility Plan:** How to course-correct if wrong

## Key Questions

- What's the best thing I could do with this time/money instead?
- If I don't do this, what happens?
- What would I need to believe for this to be the wrong choice?
- In 1 year, which choice will I wish I had made?
- What's the cost of waiting to decide?
