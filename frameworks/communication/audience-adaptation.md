## The Process

### Stage 1: Understand Your Audience

**Who are they?**
- Role/title
- Technical level
- Decision-making power
- What they care about
- Time constraints

**What do they know?**
- Existing knowledge of topic
- Context they have
- Gaps in understanding

**What do they want?**
- Their goals
- Their concerns
- Their constraints
- What success looks like for them

### Stage 2: Adapt Your Message

**For Technical Audiences:**
- Lead with specifics
- Include details and data
- Show your work
- Be precise with terminology

**For Business Audiences:**
- Lead with outcomes/impact
- Connect to business goals
- Summarize before details
- Use ROI language

**For Executive Audiences:**
- Lead with recommendation
- Keep it brief
- Focus on decisions needed
- Have details ready but don't lead with them

### Stage 3: Choose Your Format

| Audience Type | Lead With | Include | Avoid |
|---------------|-----------|---------|-------|
| Technical | How it works | Details, code, specs | Oversimplification |
| Business | What it does | Benefits, costs, timeline | Jargon |
| Executive | What you need | Decision points, risks | Long explanations |
| Customer | What's in it for them | Benefits, proof | Internal concerns |

### Stage 4: Anticipate Questions

What will they ask?
- Technical: "How does X work?"
- Business: "What's the ROI?"
- Executive: "Why should I care?"
- Customer: "Why should I trust you?"

Prepare answers before they ask.
