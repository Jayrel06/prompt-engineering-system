# Perspective Shifting Framework

## Purpose
Examine problems from multiple viewpoints to uncover insights, challenge assumptions, and develop more robust solutions.

## When to Use
- When stuck on a problem
- Before making important decisions
- When designing products or experiences
- To challenge your own thinking
- When stakeholders have conflicting needs

---

## The Process

### Stage 1: Define the Problem from Your Perspective
Start with how you currently see it.

**Your current view:**
- What is the problem?
- Why does it matter?
- What are the constraints?
- What solutions seem obvious?

**Your biases:**
- What's your role/background?
- What do you stand to gain/lose?
- What assumptions are you making?
- What do you want the answer to be?

**Acknowledge your lens:**
- I'm viewing this as a [role]
- I care most about [value]
- I'm optimizing for [outcome]
- I might be blind to [perspective]

### Stage 2: Stakeholder Perspectives
See through the eyes of everyone affected.

**Identify all stakeholders:**
- Who is affected by this?
- Who has input/influence?
- Who benefits/suffers from outcomes?
- Who has been forgotten?

**For each key stakeholder:**

**Perspective template:**
```
Stakeholder: [Role/person]

Their goals:
- What do they want to achieve?
- What does success look like to them?

Their constraints:
- What limits them?
- What are they measured on?
- What pressures do they face?

Their concerns:
- What worries them about this?
- What could go wrong for them?

From their view, the problem is:
- [Restate problem in their terms]

What they'd prioritize:
- [What matters most to them]

What they'd suggest:
- [Likely solution from their view]
```

**Key stakeholders to consider:**

**End users:**
- What do they actually need?
- What pain does this solve/cause for them?
- What's their context/environment?

**Decision makers:**
- What are they optimizing for?
- What risks concern them?
- What would make them say yes/no?

**Implementers:**
- Who has to build/execute this?
- What makes their job harder/easier?
- What technical constraints exist?

**Maintainers:**
- Who has to support this long-term?
- What creates maintenance burden?
- What makes things break?

**Affected parties:**
- Who experiences side effects?
- Whose workflow changes?
- Who bears hidden costs?

### Stage 3: Time Perspectives
View the problem across different time horizons.

**Past perspective (looking back):**
- How did we get here?
- What was tried before?
- What worked/didn't work historically?
- What patterns repeat?
- What lessons were learned?

**Questions:**
- If I could tell my past self one thing, what would it be?
- What would I have done differently 6 months ago?
- What seemed important then but isn't now?

**Present perspective (now):**
- What's actually happening today?
- What are immediate needs?
- What's urgent vs important?
- What are we optimizing for now?

**Questions:**
- If I only had today to solve this, what would I do?
- What's the minimum viable solution?
- What's preventing action right now?

**Near future (3-6 months):**
- Where should we be?
- What milestones matter?
- What needs to be true?
- What could go wrong?

**Questions:**
- What will I wish I had done today?
- What seeds should I plant now?
- What decisions are reversible?

**Far future (2-5 years):**
- What's the long-term vision?
- What foundational work is needed?
- What becomes possible?
- What scales, what doesn't?

**Questions:**
- Will this matter in 2 years?
- What enables the next 10 moves?
- What would future me thank me for?

**Legacy perspective (10+ years):**
- What lasting impact remains?
- What really mattered?
- What was distraction?
- What set direction?

**Questions:**
- What would I regret not doing?
- What creates lasting value?
- What will be obvious in hindsight?

### Stage 4: Scale Perspectives
Zoom in and out to see different details.

**Micro view (smallest scale):**
- Individual interactions
- Specific implementation details
- Moment-to-moment experience
- Edge cases and specifics

**Questions:**
- What happens in the first 30 seconds?
- What's the literal first step?
- What details matter enormously?
- What breaks in practice?

**Meso view (medium scale):**
- Workflows and processes
- Team or department level
- Days to weeks timeframe
- Typical use cases

**Questions:**
- How does this fit into daily work?
- What's the common scenario?
- How does this connect to other systems?
- What's the normal case?

**Macro view (largest scale):**
- Organizational impact
- Market dynamics
- Strategic positioning
- Industry trends

**Questions:**
- How does this affect the business?
- What's the competitive implication?
- What does this enable strategically?
- What trend is this part of?

**Systems view (interconnections):**
- How parts interact
- Feedback loops
- Unintended consequences
- Emergent properties

**Questions:**
- What else does this affect?
- What feedback loops exist?
- What happens at scale?
- What are second-order effects?

### Stage 5: Alternative Framings
Reframe the problem entirely.

**Opposite framing:**
- Instead of "How do we X?" ask "How do we avoid X?"
- Instead of "Make this better" ask "What if we removed it?"
- Instead of "How do we win?" ask "How do we not lose?"

**Constraint shifting:**
- What if we had 100x the budget?
- What if we had 1/10 the budget?
- What if we had 1 day instead of 1 month?
- What if we had to use completely different technology?

**Analogical thinking:**
- How would [other industry] solve this?
- What's this problem similar to?
- How do people solve similar problems in nature?
- What can we learn from similar failures?

**Provocative questions:**
- What if the opposite is true?
- What if our biggest constraint is actually an advantage?
- What are we assuming that's probably wrong?
- What would a naive person suggest?

### Stage 6: Synthesis
Integrate insights from all perspectives.

**Collect insights:**
| Perspective | Key Insight | Implication |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| User | | |
| Implementer | | |
| 6 months out | | |
| Micro scale | | |

**Look for:**
- **Consensus:** What do all perspectives agree on?
- **Conflicts:** Where do perspectives clash?
- **Blind spots:** What did single perspective miss?
- **Surprises:** What changed when viewpoint changed?

**Questions:**
- What seemed important from one view but not others?
- What was missed initially?
- What conflicts must be resolved?
- What creative tensions exist?

**Refined understanding:**
```
Original problem: [Initial framing]

Reframed problem: [After perspective shifting]

Key insights:
1. [Insight that changes approach]
2. [Insight that changes approach]
3. [Insight that changes approach]

New approach:
[Solution that accounts for multiple perspectives]
```

## Perspective Shifting Techniques

### Role-playing
Literally imagine being the other person:
- "I am [user]. I wake up and..."
- "I am [engineer]. My day is..."
- "I am [executive]. I care about..."

### Time traveling
Write from the future:
- "It's 6 months from now, and this succeeded because..."
- "It's 2 years from now, and this failed because..."
- "I'm looking back at this decision and I'm glad/regret..."

### Constraint removal
Remove one constraint at a time:
- No budget limit
- No time limit
- No technical constraints
- No existing systems

Then ask: What does this reveal about the real problem?

### Empathy mapping
For key stakeholders, map:
- What do they see? (environment, context)
- What do they hear? (what others say)
- What do they think/feel? (worries, aspirations)
- What do they say/do? (actions, behaviors)

### Five perspectives exercise
Quickly answer from five views:
1. User perspective
2. Business perspective
3. Technical perspective
4. Competitor perspective
5. Naive outsider perspective

## Common Perspective Traps

### Echo chamber
- Only considering perspectives similar to yours
- Dismissing viewpoints you don't understand
- Seeking confirmation, not challenge

**Fix:** Actively seek opposing views. Talk to actual stakeholders.

### Analysis paralysis
- Infinite perspectives, no decision
- "We need to consider everyone"
- Every viewpoint has equal weight

**Fix:** Prioritize perspectives based on impact and importance.

### False equivalence
- Treating all perspectives as equally valid
- Ignoring evidence/expertise
- "It's just your opinion"

**Fix:** Weight perspectives by expertise, data, and impact.

### Losing yourself
- Forgetting your own perspective
- Trying to please everyone
- No clear point of view

**Fix:** Return to your role and responsibility. You're here for a reason.

## When Each Perspective Matters Most

### Stakeholder perspectives
- Critical when: Multiple parties affected, politics involved
- Less important when: Clear owner, simple decision

### Time perspectives
- Critical when: Long-term implications, technical architecture
- Less important when: Temporary fix, experiment

### Scale perspectives
- Critical when: Growth expected, system design
- Less important when: Isolated change, well-defined scope

### Alternative framings
- Critical when: Stuck, conventional approaches failing
- Less important when: Clear path forward, proven solution

## Examples

### Product Decision
**Original:** "Should we build feature X?"

**After perspective shifting:**
- **User:** "I need this workflow to be faster" (not feature X)
- **Engineer:** "This adds tech debt we can't afford"
- **6 months out:** "Feature X doesn't matter, retention does"
- **Macro:** "Our competitors are focusing elsewhere"

**Reframed:** "How do we improve workflow speed with minimal tech debt?"

### Technical Architecture
**Original:** "Which database should we use?"

**After perspective shifting:**
- **Future maintainer:** "Can our team actually operate this?"
- **Scale view:** "Will this handle 100x growth?"
- **Cost view:** "Can we afford this at scale?"
- **2 years out:** "Is this still maintained/supported?"

**Reframed:** "What's the lowest risk database choice given our constraints?"

### Strategic Direction
**Original:** "Should we pursue market A or market B?"

**After perspective shifting:**
- **Customer:** "Neither market is asking for this exact thing"
- **Past:** "We failed in market A before, why?"
- **Competitor:** "They're ignoring market C entirely"
- **Opposite:** "What if we served both with a platform?"

**Reframed:** "What underlying need connects these markets?"
