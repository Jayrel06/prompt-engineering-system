# Iterative Refinement Framework

## Purpose
Improve creative work through structured cycles of creation, critique, and targeted improvement. Quality emerges from iteration, not first drafts.

## When to Use
- Writing content (articles, documentation, proposals)
- Designing interfaces or experiences
- Creating presentations or communications
- Developing creative solutions
- Any work where quality matters more than speed

## The Process

### Stage 1: Initial Creation
Create a complete first version without self-editing.

**Focus on:**
- Getting ideas out of your head
- Completeness over perfection
- Capturing core intent
- Establishing structure

**Questions to answer:**
- What's the main message/goal?
- Who is this for?
- What should they understand/feel/do?
- What are the key components?

**Output:** A complete first draft, however rough.

### Stage 2: Gap Analysis
Compare what you created to what you intended.

**Evaluate against intent:**
| Aspect | Intended | Actual | Gap |
|--------|----------|--------|-----|
| Main message | | | |
| Audience fit | | | |
| Completeness | | | |
| Clarity | | | |
| Impact | | | |

**Questions to ask:**
- Does this achieve the goal?
- Is anything missing?
- Is anything unnecessary?
- Would the audience understand this?

### Stage 3: Self-Critique
Identify specific weaknesses without fixing them yet.

**Look for:**
- **Structural issues:** Organization, flow, missing sections
- **Clarity problems:** Confusing parts, jargon, assumptions
- **Engagement gaps:** Boring sections, weak openings/closings
- **Factual issues:** Errors, unsupported claims, inconsistencies
- **Style problems:** Tone mismatch, repetition, wordiness

**Critique format:**
```
Problem: [Specific issue]
Location: [Where it occurs]
Impact: [Why it matters]
Severity: Critical / Important / Minor
```

### Stage 4: Targeted Improvement
Fix issues one category at a time, highest impact first.

**Priority order:**
1. **Critical fixes:** Errors, major structural problems
2. **Clarity improvements:** Make it understandable
3. **Engagement enhancements:** Make it compelling
4. **Polish:** Style, flow, word choice

**For each improvement:**
- Change one thing at a time
- Verify the change improves it
- Check you didn't break something else

### Stage 5: External Perspective
View your work as the audience would.

**Fresh eyes techniques:**
- Wait 24 hours, then read again
- Read out loud
- Read backwards (last section first)
- Imagine explaining it to someone

**Check:**
- Does the opening hook attention?
- Is the flow logical?
- Are transitions smooth?
- Does the conclusion satisfy?
- Would you keep reading/using this?

### Stage 6: Final Polish
Small refinements that elevate the work.

**Focus areas:**
- **First impressions:** Opening, title, visual appeal
- **Last impressions:** Conclusion, call to action
- **Readability:** Sentence length, paragraph breaks, formatting
- **Precision:** Exact word choice, eliminating filler
- **Consistency:** Tone, terminology, style

**Questions:**
- What's the one thing that would improve this most?
- What can be removed without loss?
- Where does it drag?
- Where does it shine?

## Output Format

After completing the refinement cycle, document:

1. **Version Summary**
   - What changed from v1 to final
   - Major improvements made

2. **Key Decisions**
   - Important choices and rationale
   - Trade-offs accepted

3. **Quality Assessment**
   - Strengths of final version
   - Remaining limitations
   - Confidence level (1-10)

4. **Lessons Learned**
   - What worked in this iteration
   - What to do differently next time

## Iteration Guidelines

### When to Iterate Again
- Critical flaws remain
- Doesn't achieve core goal
- Audience wouldn't understand/engage
- You're not confident in quality

### When to Stop Iterating
- No critical issues remain
- Further changes are marginal
- Deadline pressure outweighs gains
- Diminishing returns on time invested

### Avoiding Common Traps

**Over-refinement:**
- Making changes for the sake of change
- Perfecting things that don't matter
- Missing deadlines for marginal gains

**Under-refinement:**
- Publishing first drafts
- Skipping the critique phase
- Not considering audience perspective

**Wrong focus:**
- Polishing style before fixing structure
- Perfecting details while core is broken
- Optimizing for yourself, not audience

## Adaptation for Different Work Types

### Writing
- v1: Brain dump
- v2: Structure and flow
- v3: Clarity and precision
- v4: Style and polish

### Design
- v1: Rough sketches
- v2: Core functionality
- v3: User experience
- v4: Visual refinement

### Code
- v1: Make it work
- v2: Make it right
- v3: Make it maintainable
- v4: Optimize if needed

### Strategy
- v1: Initial direction
- v2: Validate assumptions
- v3: Address weaknesses
