# Decision Matrix Framework

## Purpose
Structured comparison of options using weighted criteria. Makes complex decisions more objective and defensible.

## When to Use
- Comparing multiple options
- When stakeholders disagree
- For decisions that need documentation
- When intuition isn't enough

## The Process

### Stage 1: Define Criteria

What matters for this decision?

**Common Criteria:**
- Cost (upfront and ongoing)
- Time to implement
- Risk level
- Strategic fit
- Ease of use
- Scalability
- Maintenance burden
- Team capability

**Choose 5-7 criteria that actually differentiate options.**

### Stage 2: Weight Criteria

Not all criteria matter equally. Distribute 100 points across criteria.

| Criterion | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Cost | 25 |
| Time | 20 |
| Risk | 20 |
| Fit | 20 |
| Ease | 15 |
| **Total** | **100** |

### Stage 3: Score Options

Rate each option on each criterion (1-5).

| Criterion | Weight | Option A | Option B | Option C |
|-----------|--------|----------|----------|----------|
| Cost | 25 | 4 | 3 | 5 |
| Time | 20 | 3 | 5 | 2 |
| Risk | 20 | 4 | 3 | 4 |
| Fit | 20 | 5 | 3 | 3 |
| Ease | 15 | 3 | 4 | 3 |

### Stage 4: Calculate Weighted Scores

Multiply score by weight for each cell, sum columns.

| Criterion | Weight | Option A | Option B | Option C |
|-----------|--------|----------|----------|----------|
| Cost | 25 | 100 | 75 | 125 |
| Time | 20 | 60 | 100 | 40 |
| Risk | 20 | 80 | 60 | 80 |
| Fit | 20 | 100 | 60 | 60 |
| Ease | 15 | 45 | 60 | 45 |
| **Total** | | **385** | **355** | **350** |

### Stage 5: Sanity Check

Does the result match your intuition?
- If yes: Good, you have defensible decision
- If no: Examine why. Adjust weights? Missing criteria? Intuition wrong?

### Stage 6: Document Decision

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| Decision | [What was chosen] |
| Alternatives | [What was considered] |
| Criteria | [What mattered] |
| Rationale | [Why this choice] |
| Risks | [What could go wrong] |
| Date | [When decided] |
