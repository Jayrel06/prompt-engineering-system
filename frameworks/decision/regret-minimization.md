## The Process

### Stage 1: Project Forward
Imagine yourself at 80 (or 10/20 years from now).

**Visualize:**
- Where you are
- What you've accomplished
- What mattered and what didn't
- Your overall life satisfaction

### Stage 2: Look Back at This Decision
From that future perspective, evaluate each option.

**For each option, ask:**
- Will I regret NOT doing this?
- Will I regret DOING this?
- What matters about this in the long run?
- Is this fear of short-term discomfort or genuine wisdom?

### Stage 3: Identify Regret Sources

**Regrets of Inaction:**
- Not trying something
- Playing it safe
- Letting fear decide
- Not taking the chance

**Regrets of Action:**
- Making a mistake
- Causing harm
- Wasting resources
- Looking foolish

**Research consistently shows:** People regret inaction more than action over the long term.

### Stage 4: Minimize Long-Term Regret
Which choice leads to fewer regrets in 10+ years?

| Option | Potential Regrets | Long-Term Significance |
|--------|-------------------|------------------------|
| | | |

### Stage 5: Decide from Future Perspective
What would your future self want you to do?

- "Is this fear or wisdom guiding me?"
- "What would I tell someone else in this situation?"
- "Am I optimizing for short-term comfort or long-term fulfillment?"

## Origin

This framework was popularized by Jeff Bezos for his decision to leave a well-paying job to start Amazon:

> "I wanted to project myself forward to age 80 and say, 'Okay, now I'm looking back on my life. I want to have minimized the number of regrets I have.' I knew that when I was 80 I was not going to regret having tried this... I knew that if I failed I wouldn't regret that, but I knew the one thing I might regret is not ever having tried."
