# Reversibility Assessment Framework

## Purpose
Distinguish between one-way doors (irreversible) and two-way doors (reversible) to calibrate decision speed and rigor appropriately.

## When to Use
- Before any significant decision
- When unsure how much analysis is needed
- When pressure to decide quickly exists
- To avoid both analysis paralysis and recklessness

## The Process

### Stage 1: Describe the Decision
What are you deciding?

**Clarify:**
- The choice being made
- What changes if you proceed
- Who is affected
- Timeline involved

### Stage 2: Assess Reversibility

**One-Way Door (Type 1) Indicators:**
- Large capital expenditure
- Public commitment (announcement, contract)
- Burning bridges with alternatives
- Reputation at stake
- Legal or regulatory implications
- Team members hired or fired
- Technical architecture that's hard to change

**Two-Way Door (Type 2) Indicators:**
- Can easily undo or change course
- Low switching costs
- Minimal public visibility
- Experiment can be stopped
- No long-term commitments
- Easy to try alternative later

### Stage 3: Evaluate Reversal Difficulty

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Cost to reverse | $ |
| Time to reverse | days/weeks/months |
| Effort to reverse | low/medium/high |
| Damage while reversing | minimal/moderate/significant |
| Learning lost if reversed | little/some/significant |

### Stage 4: Match Process to Decision Type

**Type 1 (One-Way Door):**
- More analysis required
- Seek diverse input
- Consider alternatives thoroughly
- Document reasoning
- Don't rush

**Type 2 (Two-Way Door):**
- Decide quickly
- Bias toward action
- Learn by doing
- Iterate based on feedback
- Avoid over-analysis

### Stage 5: Decide

Based on reversibility assessment, what's the right approach?

## Output Format

1. **Decision:** What you're deciding
2. **Door Type:** One-way or two-way (with confidence)
3. **Reversal Analysis:** Cost, time, effort, damage
4. **Appropriate Process:** How much rigor is warranted
5. **Recommendation:** Decide now, analyze more, or test first

## Common Mistakes

### Treating Two-Way as One-Way
- Over-analyzing reversible decisions
- Seeking excessive consensus
- Missing opportunities while deliberating
- Analysis paralysis

### Treating One-Way as Two-Way
- Moving too fast on irreversible choices
- Not seeking enough input
- Ignoring warning signs
- "Move fast and break things" on things that can't be unbroken

## Examples

### One-Way Doors
- Hiring a key executive
- Major acquisition
- Public product launch
- Signing multi-year contract
- Announcing company direction

### Two-Way Doors
- Testing a new feature with small group
- Trying a new tool internally
- Small marketing experiment
- Process improvement pilot
- Most technical decisions
