# Second-Order Effects Framework

## Purpose
Think beyond immediate consequences to downstream effects. Most unintended consequences come from ignoring second and third-order effects.

## When to Use
- Before major decisions
- When evaluating policies or processes
- When something has many stakeholders
- For strategic planning

## The Process

### Stage 1: Define the Action
What decision or change are you considering?

**State clearly:**
- What will change
- Who is directly affected
- Intended first-order effect

### Stage 2: Map First-Order Effects
What happens immediately as a result?

| First-Order Effect | Who's Affected | Positive/Negative |
|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| | | |

### Stage 3: Map Second-Order Effects
What happens as a result of the first-order effects?

For each first-order effect, ask: "And then what?"

| First-Order | → Second-Order | → Third-Order |
|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| | | |

### Stage 4: Identify Stakeholder Responses
How will different people respond to the changes?

**Stakeholders to consider:**
- Direct users/customers
- Competitors
- Partners
- Employees
- Regulators
- The market

| Stakeholder | Likely Response | Effect of Response |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| | | |

### Stage 5: Look for Feedback Loops
Do any effects reinforce or counteract the original action?

**Reinforcing loops:** Effect makes more of itself
**Balancing loops:** Effect limits or reverses itself

### Stage 6: Net Assessment
After tracing effects, is the action still worth it?

## Output Format

1. **Action:** What's being considered
2. **Intended Effect:** What you hope happens
3. **Effect Chain:** First → Second → Third order
4. **Stakeholder Responses:** How others will react
5. **Feedback Loops:** Self-reinforcing or self-limiting dynamics
6. **Net Assessment:** Overall recommendation

## Example

**Action:** Lower prices by 20%

**First-Order:**
- More customers buy
- Less revenue per sale

**Second-Order:**
- Competitors respond by lowering prices
- Brand perceived as "cheap"
- Customers expect low prices permanently

**Third-Order:**
- Price war erodes industry margins
- Quality pressure increases
- Some competitors exit market

**Net Assessment:** Short-term gain, long-term commoditization risk
