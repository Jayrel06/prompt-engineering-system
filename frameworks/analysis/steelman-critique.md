# Steelman Critique Framework

## Purpose
Evaluate ideas fairly by first making them as strong as possible, then critiquing. Prevents dismissing good ideas prematurely and strengthens your own thinking.

## When to Use
- Evaluating your own ideas before committing
- Considering competitors or alternatives
- Making important decisions with opposing options
- Checking for blind spots in your thinking

---

## The Process

### Stage 1: State the Idea
Clearly articulate the idea being evaluated.

**Include:**
- Core claim or proposal
- Who supports this idea and why
- What problem it solves
- Why it might be appealing

### Stage 2: Steelman It
Make the strongest possible case FOR the idea.

**Assume:**
- The smartest version of this argument
- The best intentions of proponents
- Access to information you might not have
- Valid reasons for choices that seem wrong

**Questions to strengthen:**
- What would make this undeniably correct?
- What evidence would most support this?
- What would a brilliant advocate say?
- What am I missing that supporters see?

### Stage 3: Identify Strengths
What's genuinely good about this idea?

| Strength | Evidence | Conditions Where This Excels |
|----------|----------|------------------------------|
| | | |

### Stage 4: Honest Critique
Now critique the strengthened version.

**Types of critique:**
- **Logical:** Does the reasoning hold?
- **Empirical:** Does evidence support it?
- **Practical:** Can it actually be implemented?
- **Contextual:** Does it apply to this situation?

| Weakness | Why It Matters | How It Could Be Addressed |
|----------|----------------|---------------------------|
| | | |

### Stage 5: Synthesize
What's the balanced view?

**Consider:**
- When is this idea correct?
- When is it incorrect?
- What would need to be true for it to work?
- How could it be improved?

## Output Format

1. **Idea Statement:** Clear articulation
2. **Steelmanned Case:** Strongest version of the argument
3. **Genuine Strengths:** What's actually good
4. **Valid Critiques:** Real weaknesses (of the strong version)
5. **Synthesis:** Balanced conclusion
6. **Recommendation:** Based on analysis

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Strawmanning
- Attacking weak version of argument
- Misrepresenting opponent's position
- Ignoring context or nuance

### Motivated Reasoning
- Only finding flaws in ideas you dislike
- Only finding strengths in ideas you like
- Stopping analysis when you find support

### False Balance
- Treating all critiques as equally valid
- Pretending both sides are equally strong
- Avoiding conclusions
