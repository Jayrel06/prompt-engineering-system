# Assumption Surfacing Framework

## Purpose
Identify hidden assumptions that might invalidate your plans. Most failures come from wrong assumptions, not poor execution.

## When to Use
- Before starting major initiatives
- When plans seem too straightforward
- When something feels off but you can't articulate why
- During project retrospectives

## The Process

### Stage 1: State Your Conclusion
What are you planning to do or believe?

**Articulate:**
- The plan or decision
- Why it seems correct
- Expected outcome
- Timeline

### Stage 2: Surface Assumptions
What must be true for this to work?

**Categories to probe:**

**About the Market:**
- Customer needs are [X]
- Market size is [Y]
- Competition will [Z]

**About Technology:**
- This solution is technically feasible
- Performance will be adequate
- Integration is possible

**About Resources:**
- We have enough time
- Budget is sufficient
- Skills are available

**About Execution:**
- Team can deliver
- Dependencies will be met
- Plan will survive contact with reality

**About Environment:**
- External conditions remain stable
- No major disruptions
- Stakeholders stay aligned

### Stage 3: Categorize Assumptions

| Assumption | Certainty (1-10) | Impact if Wrong (1-10) | Evidence |
|------------|------------------|------------------------|----------|
| | | | |

**Priority = Low Certainty + High Impact**

### Stage 4: Test Key Assumptions
For high-priority assumptions, how can we test them?

| Assumption | Test Method | Cost to Test | Time to Test |
|------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| | | | |

**Good tests:**
- Fast and cheap
- Provide clear signal
- Done before major commitment

### Stage 5: Contingency Planning
What if key assumptions are wrong?

| Assumption | If Wrong, We Will... | Early Warning Signs |
|------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| | | |

## Output Format

1. **Plan Summary:** What we're assuming will work
2. **Key Assumptions:** Ranked by priority (low certainty × high impact)
3. **Tests:** How to validate before committing
4. **Contingencies:** What to do if wrong
5. **Decision:** Proceed, test first, or reconsider

## Common Hidden Assumptions

### About Customers
- They have the problem we think
- They'll pay what we expect
- They'll find and understand our solution
- They'll switch from current solution

### About Competition
- We know who they are
- They won't respond effectively
- Our differentiation matters
- Barriers to entry exist

### About Ourselves
- We can execute the plan
- We'll stay motivated
- Resources won't get diverted
- Our estimates are accurate

### About Timing
- Now is the right time
- We have enough runway
- Dependencies will be ready
- Market conditions will hold
