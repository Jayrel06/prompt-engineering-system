## The Process

### Stage 1: Define Analysis Scope
What are we analyzing and why?

**Clarify:**
- **Market definition:** What space are we competing in?
- **Analysis goal:** What decisions will this inform?
- **Timeframe:** Current state or trends over time?
- **Depth needed:** Quick scan or deep dive?

**Scope boundaries:**
- Geographic markets
- Customer segments
- Product categories
- Price ranges

### Stage 2: Identify Competitors
Who are we actually competing against?

**Direct Competitors:**
- Solve same problem, same way
- Target same customers
- Similar pricing/positioning

**Indirect Competitors:**
- Solve same problem, different approach
- Alternative solutions customers consider

**Future Competitors:**
- Companies that could enter this space
- Adjacent players expanding
- Emerging startups

**Competitor List Template:**
| Company | Type | Market Position | Why They Matter |
|---------|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| | Direct/Indirect/Future | Leader/Challenger/Niche | |

**Prioritize:** Focus on top 3-5 most relevant competitors.

### Stage 3: Feature Comparison
What does each competitor offer?

**Create comparison matrix:**

| Feature Category | Us | Competitor A | Competitor B | Competitor C |
|------------------|-----|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Core Features** | | | | |
| Feature 1 | | | | |
| Feature 2 | | | | |
| **Advanced Features** | | | | |
| Feature 3 | | | | |
| **Integrations** | | | | |
| Integration type | | | | |
| **Support** | | | | |
| Support level | | | | |

**Rating scale:** ✓✓ (Excellent) | ✓ (Good) | ~ (Basic) | ✗ (Missing)

**Look for:**
- Table stakes features (everyone has)
- Differentiators (only some have)
- Gaps (nobody has well)
- Over-served areas (commoditized)

### Stage 4: Positioning Analysis
How does each competitor position themselves?

**For each competitor, document:**

**Messaging:**
- Primary value proposition
- Target customer described
- Key differentiators claimed
- Tone and brand personality

**Pricing:**
- Price points and tiers
- Pricing model (subscription, usage, one-time)
- Free tier or trial offered
- Enterprise pricing available

**Customer Segments:**
- Who they target explicitly
- Who actually uses them (may differ)
- Customer size (SMB, mid-market, enterprise)
- Industries focused on

**Market Position:**
- Market leader / Challenger / Niche player
- Innovator / Fast follower / Cost leader
- Specialist / Generalist

### Stage 5: Strengths and Weaknesses
What is each competitor good and bad at?

**Analysis template per competitor:**

**Strengths:**
- What do they do better than others?
- What advantages do they have? (network effects, brand, technology)
- What would be hard to replicate?

**Weaknesses:**
- Where do they fall short?
- What do customers complain about?
- What constraints limit them?

**Evidence sources:**
- Customer reviews (G2, Capterra, Trustpilot)
- Social media mentions
- Customer interviews
- Trial/demo experience
- Public financials or metrics

### Stage 6: Opportunity Gaps
Where are the strategic openings?

**Identify gaps in:**

**Underserved Segments:**
- Customer types no one serves well
- Use cases not addressed
- Geographic markets overlooked

**Feature Gaps:**
- Important features no one has
- Features everyone has, but done poorly
- Emerging needs not yet met

**Positioning Gaps:**
- Value propositions unclaimed
- Price points unoccupied
- Marketing channels underutilized

**Experience Gaps:**
- Better onboarding
- Superior support
- Easier implementation
- More transparent pricing

**Opportunity Evaluation:**
| Gap | Market Size | Difficulty | Differentiation Strength | Priority |
|-----|-------------|------------|--------------------------|----------|
| | Large/Medium/Small | Easy/Medium/Hard | Strong/Moderate/Weak | High/Medium/Low |

### Stage 7: Competitive Threats
What could competitors do to us?

**Threat assessment:**
- Could they copy our differentiators?
- Could they out-execute us?
- Could they move down/up market?
- What if they merged?

**For each threat:**
- Likelihood: High / Medium / Low
- Impact: Critical / Significant / Minor
- Our defense: What would we do?
