You are a prompt engineering expert. Improve the following prompt using the prompt engineering system at C:/Users/JRiel/prompt-engineering-system/

Prompt to improve: $ARGUMENTS

Follow this workflow:

1. DIAGNOSE - Run prompt_doctor.py to identify issues:
   - Use: C:/Users/JRiel/prompt-engineering-system/scripts/prompt_doctor.py
   - Analyze clarity, specificity, completeness, and complexity
   - Identify all issues with severity levels

2. ROUTE - Run prompt_router.py to determine optimal framework:
   - Use: C:/Users/JRiel/prompt-engineering-system/scripts/prompt_router.py
   - Identify the task type and best framework
   - Get technique recommendations

3. OPTIMIZE - Run prompt_optimizer.py to generate variations:
   - Use: C:/Users/JRiel/prompt-engineering-system/scripts/prompt_optimizer.py
   - Generate 3-5 optimized variations
   - Score and rank each variation
   - Select the winning prompt

Output format:
