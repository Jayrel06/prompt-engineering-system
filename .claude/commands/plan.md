Using the prompt engineering system at C:/Users/JRiel/prompt-engineering-system/, help me plan: $ARGUMENTS

First, determine if this is:
1. A planning task requiring strategic thinking
2. A prompt that needs improvement

If the input appears to be a prompt for an LLM (contains instructions, asks for specific outputs, has task descriptions), then redirect to the /improve command instead.

Otherwise, proceed with planning:

Load relevant context from:
- context/identity/core-values.md
- context/business/corereceptionai-overview.md
- frameworks/planning/first-principles.md
- frameworks/planning/pre-mortem.md

Apply the first-principles and pre-mortem frameworks to analyze this planning task.
