## Mission

Research web design trends, tech stacks, competitors, and implementation patterns to create a premium, differentiated landing page for CoreReceptionAI.

## Phase 1: Discovery (Parallel)

Run these searches:

1. **Trends**: "web design trends 2025", "SaaS landing page trends", "dark mode design trends"
2. **Tech Stacks**: "linear.app tech stack", "vercel website built with", "best stack for SaaS landing page"
3. **Community**: "site:reddit.com dark mode website design", "site:reddit.com framer motion vs gsap"
4. **Galleries**: Check godly.website, awwwards.com for inspiration
5. **GitHub**: "landing page template stars:>500", "aurora background react"

## Phase 2: Analysis (Parallel)

1. **Competitors**: Analyze webpt.com, cliniko.com, simplepractice.com, jane.app vs linear.app, vercel.com, stripe.com
2. **Code Patterns**: Find implementations for aurora backgrounds, glassmorphism, scroll animations
3. **UX**: Document navigation, forms, user flows
4. **Conversion**: Research CTA placement, social proof, form optimization

## Phase 3: Synthesis (Sequential)

1. Cross-reference findings (3+ sources = validated)
2. Create priority matrix (impact vs effort)
3. Build implementation roadmap
4. Generate implementation prompts

## Output

Create comprehensive report with:
- Validated design patterns
- Priority recommendations
- Code snippets
- Implementation prompts

## Constraints

- No fabricated statistics
- No geographic claims
- Include source URLs
- Note confidence levels
