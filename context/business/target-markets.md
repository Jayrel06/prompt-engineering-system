## Market Prioritization

1. **Physical Therapy** - Best understood, clearest ROI story
2. **HVAC** - High value, 24/7 need, willing to pay
3. **Home Services** - Volume play, less customization

## Not Targeting (For Now)
- Enterprise (too complex, long sales cycles)
- Retail (different dynamics)
- Restaurants (low ticket, high volume)
- Medical (heavy compliance)
