# Pricing Frameworks

## Pricing Philosophy

### Value-Based, Not Time-Based
- Price based on value delivered, not hours worked
- What's the problem worth solving?
- What's the ROI for the client?

### Cover Costs + Reasonable Margin
- Infrastructure costs
- Time investment
- Ongoing support
- 30-50% margin target

### Keep It Simple
- Easy to understand pricing
- Minimal negotiation
- Clear scope boundaries

## Pricing Calculation Framework

### For New Projects

1. **Estimate Effort**
   - Simple: 4-8 hours
   - Medium: 16-40 hours
   - Complex: 40-100 hours

2. **Calculate Base Cost**
   - Hourly rate: $100-150
   - Base = Hours × Rate

3. **Apply Value Multiplier**
   - Low value (nice-to-have): 1.0x
   - Medium value (improves efficiency): 1.5x
   - High value (revenue impact): 2.0-3.0x

4. **Add Platform Costs**
   - Pass through at cost
   - Document clearly

5. **Round to Clean Number**
   - $2,347 → $2,500
   - Easier to discuss and remember

## Discounting Guidelines

### When to Discount
- Multi-project commitment
- Case study / testimonial permission
- Referral source
- Strategic relationship

### When NOT to Discount
- "Just because they asked"
- Scope creep disguised as negotiation
- Short timeline pressure
- Red flag clients

### Maximum Discount: 20%
- Beyond 20% = red flag
- Either scope is wrong or not a fit
