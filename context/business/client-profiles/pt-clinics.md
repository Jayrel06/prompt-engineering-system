## Sales Approach

### Discovery Questions
1. "How many calls do you think you miss per week?"
2. "What happens when the front desk is busy with a patient?"
3. "How do you handle after-hours calls?"
4. "What's your biggest frustration with patient communication?"
5. "What scheduling system do you use?"

### Value Proposition
"Every missed call is a potential patient who might go to your competitor. We help PT clinics capture every inquiry with an AI receptionist that books appointments directly into your schedule."

### ROI Calculation
- Missed calls/week × new patient rate (30%) × avg case value ($2,000)
- Example: 10 missed calls × 30% × $2,000 = $6,000/week lost
- Our solution: $2,500 setup + $300/month
- Payback: < 2 weeks
