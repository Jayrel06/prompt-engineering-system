## Sales Approach

### Discovery Questions
1. "What happens when you're on a job and the phone rings?"
2. "How do you currently manage your schedule?"
3. "Do you get calls after hours?"
4. "How do you follow up with people who request quotes?"
5. "What would one more job per week be worth to you?"

### Value Proposition
"You're great at your trade. We make sure you never miss a customer because you were busy doing the work."

### ROI Calculation
- Missed calls/week × close rate × avg job value
- Example: 5 missed calls × 50% × $400 = $1,000/week lost
- Our solution: $1,500 setup + $200/month
- Payback: < 2 weeks
