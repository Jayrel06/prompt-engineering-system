## Sales Approach

### Discovery Questions
1. "What happens when a call comes in at 2am?"
2. "During your busy season, how many calls do you think you miss?"
3. "How do you currently prioritize emergencies vs routine calls?"
4. "What dispatch system do you use?"
5. "How do you follow up on quotes that don't close?"

### Value Proposition
"When a homeowner's AC breaks at 2am in August, they're calling every company until someone answers. We make sure that's always you."

### ROI Calculation
- Missed after-hours calls × close rate (40%) × avg job ($500)
- Example: 20 missed calls/month × 40% × $500 = $4,000/month lost
- Plus: emergency premium revenue
- Our solution: $3,000 setup + $400/month
- Payback: < 1 month
