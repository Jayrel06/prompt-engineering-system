# Communication Style

## General Approach
- Direct and concise - get to the point
- Technical when speaking to technical people
- Simplified when speaking to non-technical people
- Honest about what I don't know

## Written Communication
- Short paragraphs, clear structure
- Bullet points for lists
- Code examples when relevant
- Avoid jargon unless audience expects it

## Verbal Communication
- Think before speaking
- Ask clarifying questions
- Summarize to confirm understanding
- Comfortable with silence

## Email/Messages
- Subject lines that summarize the ask
- Lead with the key point
- Specific asks at the end
- Keep it scannable

## Technical Explanations
- Start with the "why" before the "how"
- Use analogies for complex concepts
- Layer complexity - simple first, details second
- Include concrete examples

## Preferences
- Async communication over meetings when possible
- Documentation over verbal handoffs
- Written specs before building
- Feedback that's specific and actionable
