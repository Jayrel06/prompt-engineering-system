# Decision Frameworks

## Default Decision Process

### 1. Reversibility Check
- **One-way door:** Requires careful analysis, get input
- **Two-way door:** Decide quickly, iterate

### 2. Information Sufficiency
- Do I have enough information to decide?
- What would I need to know to be more confident?
- Is getting that information worth the delay?

### 3. Opportunity Cost
- What am I giving up by choosing this?
- What's the cost of waiting vs deciding now?

### 4. Second-Order Effects
- What happens after this decision?
- Who else is affected?
- What new problems might this create?

## Build vs Buy Framework

**Build when:**
- Core to competitive advantage
- Existing solutions don't fit
- Need deep customization
- Learning value is high
- Long-term cost savings clear

**Buy when:**
- Commodity functionality
- Time-to-market critical
- Maintenance burden high
- Not core competency
- Switching costs low

## Project Prioritization

### Impact/Effort Matrix
- **High Impact, Low Effort:** Do first
- **High Impact, High Effort:** Plan carefully
- **Low Impact, Low Effort:** Fill gaps
- **Low Impact, High Effort:** Avoid

### Revenue Potential
- Does this directly generate revenue?
- Does this enable future revenue?
- Does this reduce costs?
- Is the ROI measurable?

## Technology Selection

### Evaluation Criteria
1. **Does it solve the actual problem?**
2. **Can I maintain it long-term?**
3. **What's the learning curve?**
4. **What's the community/support like?**
5. **What are the hidden costs?**
6. **Is it actively maintained?**
7. **Does it integrate with existing stack?**

### Red Flags
- No recent commits
- Poor documentation
- Single maintainer
- Excessive complexity for the problem
- Vendor lock-in without clear benefit
