# Core Values

## Quality Over Quantity
- Build things that work reliably
- One excellent solution beats ten mediocre ones
- Take time to do it right the first time
- Technical debt is real debt

## Honest Positioning
- Underpromise and overdeliver
- Be direct about limitations and unknowns
- Build trust through transparency
- Never oversell capabilities

## Technical Depth
- Understand systems at a fundamental level
- Self-host when practical for control and learning
- Automation that actually saves time, not just looks cool
- Prefer simple solutions that work over complex solutions that might

## Practical Solutions
- Solve real problems, not theoretical ones
- Optimize for the 80% case first
- Ship, iterate, improve
- Perfect is the enemy of good

## Independence
- Build systems I control
- Minimize vendor lock-in where practical
- Own the infrastructure, own the data
- Self-reliance over convenience (when reasonable)

## Continuous Learning
- Every project is a learning opportunity
- Document what works and what doesn't
- Share knowledge that helps others
- Stay curious about new approaches
