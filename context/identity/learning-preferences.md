# Learning Preferences

## How I Learn Best

### Hands-On Building
- Learn by doing, not just reading
- Build a small prototype first
- Break things to understand them
- Real projects over tutorials

### Documentation + Examples
- Good docs are essential
- Working code examples > abstract explanations
- Prefer repos with clear README and examples
- Video tutorials for complex visual concepts

### Iterative Understanding
- Start with the simplest version
- Add complexity incrementally
- Understand "why" before "how"
- Connect new concepts to existing knowledge

---

## Learning Anti-Patterns (For Me)

### What Doesn't Work
- Long video courses without hands-on
- Abstract theory without application
- Too many concepts at once
- Learning in isolation from real problems

### Time Wasters
- Tutorials that don't explain the "why"
- Outdated documentation
- Over-engineered example projects
- Certification prep without practical application

---

## Knowledge Retention

### What Helps Me Remember
- Writing documentation as I learn
- Building something that uses the concept
- Teaching/explaining to others
- Creating reference cheat sheets

### Spaced Repetition
- Revisit concepts after a few days
- Apply in different contexts
- Update notes with new understanding

---

## Preferred Learning Resources

### For New Technologies
1. Official documentation (quick start)
2. GitHub repos with good examples
3. Blog posts explaining real implementations
4. YouTube for visual concepts

### For Deepening Knowledge
1. Source code reading
2. Building increasingly complex projects
3. Community discussions (Discord, forums)
4. Conference talks from practitioners

---

## Time Allocation

### Learning Budget
- Dedicated learning time: 2-4 hours/week
- Integrated learning (during projects): ongoing
- Deep dives: scheduled as needed

### Priority
1. Skills directly applicable to current projects
2. Skills for near-term opportunities
3. General capability expansion
4. Exploratory/curiosity-driven
