# Reflection Log

This file stores weekly reflections on prompt engineering practice. Each reflection helps identify patterns, capture learnings, and improve over time.

# Week of 2024-11-25

## Summary
- **Total prompts/interactions:** [TBD after first week]
- **Main focus areas:** Setting up reflection system, establishing baseline
- **Time spent on prompt engineering:** [TBD]
- **Key achievement:** Created structured reflection system

## What Worked Well

### Structured Framework Creation
**Context:** Setting up prompt engineering system for consistent learning

**What I did:** Created comprehensive reflection framework with weekly/daily/monthly cadences

**Why it worked:**
- Clear structure reduces friction for doing reflections
- Multiple timeframes capture different types of insights
- Action-oriented approach ensures learnings translate to improvements

**Reusable pattern:** Framework-first approach to new practices

---

## Patterns Identified

### Positive Patterns
- Using structured frameworks reduces decision fatigue
- Templates make best practices easy to follow

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- (To be identified through actual usage)

### Emerging Patterns (Need More Data)
- Integration between reflection system and vector database

---

## Learnings to Capture

### Added to what-works.md
- [ ] Framework-first approach to new practices
- [ ] Structured reflection over ad-hoc review

### Added to what-doesnt.md
- (To be added based on experience)

### Added to insights-log.md
- [ ] Reflection systems need to be frictionless to be sustainable

---

## Templates Updated/Created

### Updated
- None this week (initial setup)

### Created
- [x] frameworks/meta/weekly-reflection.md: Comprehensive reflection guide
- [x] context/learnings/reflection-log.md: This template
- [x] scripts/reflection.py: Automated reflection generation

---

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Making reflections sustainable
**Attempted solutions:**
- Created automated analysis tool (reflection.py)
- Built structured framework to reduce cognitive load
- Integrated with existing vector database

**Resolution:** Multiple support systems (automation + framework + template)

**Learning:** Sustainable practices need both structure and automation

---

## Questions Raised

1. What's the optimal reflection cadence (daily/weekly/monthly)?
2. How to balance structured reflection vs spontaneous capture?
3. How to measure improvement in prompt engineering over time?

---

## Experiments to Try Next Week

1. [ ] Use reflection.py to generate first automated weekly report
2. [ ] Test daily quick-capture format (5-minute reflections)
3. [ ] Tag prompts consistently to enable better pattern analysis

---

## Metrics & Observations

- **Average iterations per prompt:** (Baseline to be established)
- **Categories used most:** (To be tracked)
- **Most valuable tags:** (To be identified)
- **Time saved vs manual approach:** (To be measured)

---

## Action Items

### Completed This Week
- [x] Create reflection.py script
- [x] Create weekly-reflection.md framework
- [x] Create reflection-log.md template

### For Next Week
- [ ] Run first automated reflection report
- [ ] Capture at least 5 prompt examples in vector database
- [ ] Document one successful pattern in what-works.md

### Longer-Term
- [ ] Build dashboard for reflection metrics
- [ ] Create templates based on identified patterns
- [ ] Integrate reflection insights into context-loader.py

---

## Notes & Observations

The reflection system should help identify:
- Which prompt structures consistently work
- Common failure patterns to avoid
- Opportunities for new templates
- Gaps in current knowledge

Key success metric: Are we learning faster and making fewer repeated mistakes?
