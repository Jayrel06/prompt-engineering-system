## Example: PT Clinic Outreach

### Research:
- Company: Austin Physical Therapy
- Recipient: Dr. Sarah Chen, Owner
- Size: 3 therapists
- Recent: Opened second location 2 months ago
- Pain point: Expanding = more admin burden

### Email:

```
Subject: Congrats on the new Austin PT location

Dr. Chen,

Saw the news about your second location on Lamar - congrats on the
expansion! Growing from one to two locations is a big milestone.

With expansion usually comes the challenge of not being in two places
at once, especially when it comes to handling the phones.

We help PT clinics capture every patient call with AI that books
appointments directly into your schedule. One clinic we work with
went from missing ~15 calls/week to zero, adding about $12K/month
in new patient revenue.

Would it be worth a quick call to see if this could help with
the new location ramp-up?

## Subject Line Patterns

**What works:**
- Specific reference: "Re: your Austin expansion"
- Question: "Quick question about [specific thing]"
- Mutual connection: "[Name] suggested I reach out"
- Timely: "Saw your [recent thing]"

**What doesn't work:**
- Generic: "Quick question"
- Salesy: "Boost your revenue 300%!"
- Too long: More than 5-6 words
- ALL CAPS or excessive punctuation
